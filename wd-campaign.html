        <h1>Women’s Day Campaign</h1>
        <p>
            A structured 7-day LinkedIn content series designed to celebrate 
            professional women while building brand narrative continuity.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            To celebrate International Women’s Day, I conceptualized and designed 
            a 7-day LinkedIn campaign focused on storytelling, employee recognition, 
            leadership highlights, and empowerment-driven messaging.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of creating a single celebratory post, the campaign was structured 
            as a narrative sequence — building momentum and engagement throughout the week.
        </p>

    <!-- STRATEGIC APPROACH -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Strategic Approach</h2>
        <div class="reflection-box">
            <p>
                This campaign demonstrates structured content planning, 
                platform-specific visual design, and brand-aligned storytelling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each post maintained visual consistency while adapting to its narrative 
                focus — balancing corporate professionalism with human-centered storytelling.
            </p>
            <p>
                The objective was not just celebration, but positioning the brand as 
                inclusive, people-focused, and aligned with LinkedIn’s professional tone.
